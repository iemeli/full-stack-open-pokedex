Let’s assume that the said project is written in Python. The top 5 Python linters are Pylint, Flake8, Pyright, Pylama and pycodestyle. Test tools include tools like PyUnit/UnitTest, Python Robot Framework and PyTest. For building it’s best to use Scons or Paver.

Considering CI/CD tools, Jenkins and GitHub actions are not the only ones out there. We could opt for let’s say GitLab’s CI/CD tool. It is an open source web interface that handles all the CI/CD stuff you would expect it to handle. The multitude of Jenkins and Github Actions alternatives include also tools like CircleCI, TeamCity, Travis CI, BuildMaster, Bitrise, Spinnaker, UrbanCode, Buddy, Drone.io, AWS CodePipeline, CruiseControl, Integrity, Shippable, CodeShip, Buildkite, GoCD, Semaphore CI, Microtica and AppVeyor.

Many a factor play into how you should approach deciding between a self-hosted and cloud-based CI/CD system. For more privacy and security concerned approach, you should opt for self-hosted environment, because you can be in total control of what happens, when and where. But as in every self-hosted approach, the configuration and hassle can be a bit more than with the cloud-based solution. Much of the setting up and configuration is already done for you, so this is the way to go when looking for longevity and hassle-free use.
